Athletes in Alpine Skiing events must combine speed and agility while racing down slopes at speeds of around 100km/h. Paralympic competition accommodates male and female athletes with a physical disability such as spinal injury, cerebral palsy, amputation, les autres conditions and blindness/visual impairment. Athletes compete in three categories based on their functional ability, and a results calculation system allows athletes with different disabilities to compete against each other. The rules of the International Ski Federation (FIS) are used with only a few modifications. Skiers with blindness /visual impairment are guided through the course by sighted guides using voice signals to indicate the course to follow. Athletes with physical disabilities use equipment that is adapted to their needs including single skis, sit-skis or orthopaedic aids. &#13;',\n",
